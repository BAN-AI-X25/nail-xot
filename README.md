v1.0 23/11/2019

    Publish the source code to github for collaboration on X25 Innovation

v1.0 - 15/08/2003

    -P -> pad mode, work from stdin/stdout

    -S -> scan mode, put nuas on stdin

USE <F2> to start logging in "logfile" (appends what you write AND a dump of
what you receive)

USE <F3> to stop logging

USE <F10> to exit

TODO

    Better terminal emulation

    Delete XXX comments :>

    Put multi-gateway threaded scan mode

    Why on a certain nua as I press something the screen clears?
